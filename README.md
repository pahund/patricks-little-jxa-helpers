===========================

 Shell scripts that use JavaScript for Automation in Mac OS X (JXA) to do things _very_ specific to my work setup.

 If you're not me, you'll find this only useful as a reference, you most likely won't be able to use these scripts on your own machine.

 JXA resources on the web:

 * [JavaScript for OS X Automation by Example](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/javascript-os-x-automation-example/)
 * [JavaScript for Automation Cookbook](https://github.com/dtinth/JXA-Cookbook/wiki)
 * [JXA Reference in OS X 10.10 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/Articles/OSX10-10.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014508-CH109-SW1)

## Use With Karabiner

I use [Karabiner](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner) to execute my JXA scripts using keyboard shortcuts on an [Ideazon Fang](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XBVJ4807L._SS500_.jpg) keyboard.

You can find my Karabiner configuration file here: [private.xml](karabiner/private.xml)
