===========================

 Shell scripts that use JavaScript for Automation in Mac OS X (JXA) to do things _very_ specific to my work setup.

 If you're not me, you'll find this only useful as a reference, you most likely won't be able to use these scripts on your own machine.

 JXA resources on the web:

 * [JavaScript for OS X Automation by Example](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/javascript-os-x-automation-example/)
 * [JavaScript for Automation Cookbook](https://github.com/dtinth/JXA-Cookbook/wiki)
 * [JXA Reference in OS X 10.10 Release Notes](OS X 10.10 Release Notes)
